            <AccordionTrigger>What is Falkor?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Falkor is an open-source launcher that allows you to browse games,
              explore upcoming releases, and find the best deals with built-in
              IsThereAnyDeal integration to compare prices (please note,
              purchases are made through your default browser, not within the
              app). Designed to be flexible and expandable, Falkorâ€™s core
              functionality is enhanced by community-created providers, giving
              users the power to customize and extend the app in countless ways.
